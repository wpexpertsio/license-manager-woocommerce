* Assign a generator to one (or more!) WooCommerce product(s), these products then automatically create a license key whenever they are sold.

## API Documentation ##
The plugin also offers additional endpoints for manipulating licenses and generator resources. These routes are authorized via API keys (generated through the plugin settings) and accessed via the WordPress API. An extensive [API documentation](https://www.licensemanager.at/docs/rest-api/getting-started/api-keys) is also available.

## Important Notice ##
The plugin will create two files inside the wp-content/uploads/lmfwc-files folder. These files (defuse.txt and secret.txt) contain cryptographic secrets which are automatically generated if they donâ€™t exist. These cryptographic secrets are used to encrypt, decrypt and hash your license keys. Once they are generated please back them up somewhere safe. In case you lose these two files your encrypted license keys inside the database will remain forever lost!
